<!-- Things to do -->
  <!-- 1.) since its general, use this structure for the homepage -->
      <!-- templates/home/index.html -->
      <!-- add a route in a new home.py file or in an existing file that handles general functionality -->
  


<!-- If your project is structured by features (e.g., auth, blog, groups), 
 try to keep files related to a feature within that featureâ€™s folder. 
 For example:

Blog posts go in blog/.
Authentication pages go in auth/.
Group management pages go in groups/. -->


<!-- If it is based on each of them, then it should be placed inside any of the related folder. -->
